StatStar and Lane Emden Programs written in Java.
I used the programs at http://wps.aw.com/aw_carroll_ostlie_astro_2e/0,11894,3153834-,00.html as guides.

## How to run

1.  Open a terminal and go the project of your choosing.
2.  Go to the dist directory.
3.  Type ´java -jar <StatStar.jar | LaneEmden.jar>´ and press enter.
